# Vegetarian restaurant example page

## I've decide to make a website for restaurant, that is concise, have everything a customer needs and generally is better than 99% of restaurant pages, that I've come a cross about

### Main goals:

#### Contain **only** necessary info:

- Name of a restaurant
- Location with button that leads directly to Google Maps on your device
- When restaurant is open
- If it is open **right now**
- Menu on front page, with options for sugar/gluten-free/peanuts-free and with all ingredients, so I don't have to ask a intern waitress, if there is butter in my 'technically vegan' dish.

#### Total lack of:

- Political statements
- Google map marker for web (didn't work, never will be)
- History about the owner (I don't care)
- Owner mission/life goals/ giant f\*\*\* banners, that didn't tell anything about, and other bloated components, that make loading time 10x more that it needs to be

### Made in pure HTML/CSS/JS without any framework

(In the future maybe add React version)
